I still talk every day with friends I made then. I don't want to disparage IT Tallaght but this university offered a much better education in the same time frame (and this was confirmed to me by people in Ireland who did their first 2 years there).</p><p class=\"my-4\"><a href=\"img/dut.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"a\">Here</a> is the diploma.</p></article>"
