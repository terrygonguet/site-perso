Because I always wanted to be my own boss and work on what I want the three of us applied (my friend, one of his friends and me) and got in!</p>  <p class=\"my-4\">So since September 2019 we're trying to get <a href=\"https://interestingby.design\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"a\">IBD</a> off the ground, providing custom websites for any possible needs.</p>  <p class=\"my-4\">I'll have more to say about the adventure when it is properly finished (and hopefully our partnership isn't).</p></article>"
