I guess everybody kind of does after having had a boss for long enough but I knew even before getting into the working world. After finishing my studies I thought I had the skills and the drive necessary to be self-employed at least even if there were parts of it that I dreaded (like custommer acquisition). However afer a while of struggling in my little corner of France I tried another approach.</p>  <p class=\"my-4\">If I couldn't do it alone, surely I could complement someone else's skillset well enough to permit both of us to live from our work, right? And so I partnered with two other friends to form <a href=\"https://interestingby.design\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"a\">Interesting By Design</a> and give it a shot. We're still in the middle of that experiment but I learned a lot about myself already.</p>  <p class=\"my-4\">As much as I think I want to be self-employed I <em>cannot for the life of me</em> do custommer acquisition. It is just not an option for it to be part of my work. Thankfully my other 2 partners are pretty good at it compared to it and I try to make up my lack of involvment with technical skill.</p>  <p class=\"my-4\">I will likely have more to say about this when the experiment is done and make a blog post about it.</p></article>"
