	"content": "<article class=\"text-justify\">  <p class=\"my-4\">Right after the DUT I had the opportunity of doing one year abroad as part of the DUETI program with Erasmus. It looked really appealing because I could do it in an english speaking country (I was already fluent then) and I would get up to 3 diplomas at the end:</p>  <ul class=\"list-disc\">    <li class=\"ml-8\"><a href=\"img/dueti.jpg\" class=\"a\" target=\"_blank\">DUETI</a></li>    <li class=\"ml-8\"><a href=\"img/bachelor.jpg\" class=\"a\" target=\"_blank\">Diploma from the university I went to</a></li>    <li class=\"ml-8\"><a href=\"img/license.jpg\" class=\"a\" target=\"_blank\">Licence Informatique in France</a></li>  </ul>  <p class=\"my-4\">The choice was pretty obvious so I chose to try and go to Ireland. After the exchange I just stayed there for 1 more year in the IT Tallaght to complete the 4 years Bachelor course and get <a href=\"img/bachelor-honours.jpg\" class=\"a\" target=\"_blank\">yet another diploma</a> (although suspiciously similar to the previous one).</p>  <p class=\"my-4\">I talk more in detail about the whole experience in <a href=\"blog/2-years-in-ireland\" class=\"a\">this blog post</a>.</p></article>"
