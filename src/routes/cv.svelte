      I am a full stack web developer and even though I know some things about
      "traditional" languages and technologies like Haskell (ðŸ’œ), PHP (ðŸ¤¢), .NET, Java etc, I am much more proficient
      with the web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS). I can (and do) develop both the front and back end of NodeJS applications.

      I take good pride in my technical skills and spend a good amount of time keeping them sharp but I think my
      best skill is learning. I <strong class="underline">love</strong> to learn new things all the time, especially if they can help
      me to do my job better or more efficiently.
